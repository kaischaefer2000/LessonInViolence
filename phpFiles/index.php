                Listen you metalheads out there!<br><br>
                During this fucking pandemic we were literally imprisoned but we used
                the time to set up the recording of our first album. So we tried to make
                the best out of it and now we are done with most of the recordings.
                Right now we are recording the vocals. When it's done there will be only
                backing vocals left. After that it will take time to mix a sound, that
                will blow everyones mind.<br>
                As you can see, the process is going on and is pretty much advanced.
                When we are done we will chose the songs for our album wisely, that
                you get the full package of our thrash enthusiasm!<br>
                We can´t wait to return to the stage, hopefully in 2021. Till then,
                don't bother yourselves too much because of all the shit that's going on.
                Just think to yourself „ALL YOU NEED IS THRASH“!
